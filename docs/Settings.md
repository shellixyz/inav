| airmode_throttle_threshold | 1300 | 1000 | 2000 | Defines airmode THROTTLE activation threshold when `airmode_type` **THROTTLE_THRESHOLD** is used |
| airmode_type | STICK_CENTER |  |  | Defines the Airmode state handling type. Default **STICK_CENTER** is the classical approach in which Airmode is always active if enabled, but when the throttle is low and ROLL/PITCH/YAW sticks are centered, Iterms is not allowed to grow (ANTI_WINDUP). **THROTTLE_THRESHOLD** is the Airmode behavior known from Betaflight. In this mode, Airmode is active as soon THROTTLE position is above `airmode_throttle_threshold` and stays active until disarm. ANTI_WINDUP is never triggered. For small Multirotors (up to 7-inch propellers) it is suggested to switch to **THROTTLE_THRESHOLD** since it keeps full stabilization no matter what pilot does with the sticks. Fixed Wings always use **STICK_CENTER_ONCE** or **STICK_CENTER** modes. |

| serialrx_halfduplex | AUTO |  |  | Allow serial receiver to operate on UART TX pin. With some receivers will allow control and telemetry over a single wire. |
| serialrx_inverted | OFF |  |  | Reverse the serial inversion of the serial RX protocol. When this value is OFF, each protocol will use its default signal (e.g. SBUS will use an inverted signal).
